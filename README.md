Bulk Edit Alt Text in Eazyest Gallery Images

This is needed when using Eazyest Gallery with Jetpack's Tiled Galleries. You'll notice that the alt text is blank (unless you individually add alt text to each Media Library image.). Without Jetpack's Tiled Galleries, Eazyest Gallery will give your images the "alt" attribute. But with Tiled Galleries, the "alt" attribute is blank.

This plugin fixes that problem. It will not override any existing "alt" text. If an Eazyest Gallery image has no "alt" text, then it will give it alt text. It will use the image caption (post_excerpt), if there is one, otherwise it will use the image title for the alt text.

Usage
===========
To update the alt text, go to Eazyest Gallery --> Bulk Edit Alt Text.
